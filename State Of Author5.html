         <p align="left">   During this time at the current date, it is known that mainly British officers were in charge of administering the affairs of the country since the country was yet a British colony and there was yet no form of actual government since the country was not yet independent and at the time did not yet elect Belizean commissioners since no form of democracy was developed as of yet. Therefore it can be surmised that Mr. Fred W Brunton was mostly likely a British officer that was appointed by the English crown to be Commissioner of British Honduras and as were most people who governed the colony.
            After placing deep analytical thought, it can be understood that the Guatemala and British Honduras were building tension towards the markings and distribution of land. I believe the main purpose for the documentation of these reports is to hold accountability, reason, or even evidence in case of any future disputes. In any event which they would breach the accords made or make any false allegations then, this exchange of documents of the agreements would serve as strong evidence of the affirmations established, which would be difficult to argue against.
            At the time both countries were seeking to arrange agreements on where to establish the borders dividing the two countries and trying to figure out how much land should they concede and how much the other wanted to gain. Therefore Documentation of these reports between foreign ministers, and commissioners of Guatemala and Belize (British Honduras) at the time were to discuss and reach agreement on where to establish land borders between these two countries, while of course still trying to gain the most satisfactory deal that would benefit both countries equally or one that would not leave the other dissatisfied.
