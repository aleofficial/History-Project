         <p align="left">In short the main part of Belize’s case rested upon two main treaties: the 1859 convention (Anglo Guatemalan treaty) and the 1931 exchange of notes which supported Belize’s title. Throughout all those years, Guatemala was never on board with any of the communications; they later declared the 1859 treaty as void, broke off diplomatic relations with Britain in 1985, and even rejected Belize’s right to independence. The controversy that this caused led to decreasing the relationship between neighbouring countries, and recently made the Belize economy face the seating and judgement from the International Court of Justice. All these reports, and sources that have been gathered for this analysis helps to educate the reasoning of the Guatemala – Belize dispute. The records, images, and other sources that help segment history data linings is evident within this folder that composed of report between countries, and other rules and regulations to the claim of British Honduras, later known as Belize.
