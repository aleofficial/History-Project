         <p align="left">Furthermore, Spain continued to attack Belize to reclaim sovereignty, and a number of treaties between Spain and England were reached between 1783(Treaty of Versailles “Paris”) and 1786 (Convention of London), the entailing’s of these treaties allowed the Baymen to continue cutting logwood during this period. On September 10th, 1798, a critical battle took place between the Baymen and the Spanish at St. George’s Caye, as part of the outbreak of war between Britain and Spain. The Baymen, against considerable odds, defeated the Spanish for the last time. From that point on Britain assumed greater control over the settlement.
            To the right is attached a primary source of a letter sent by the Acting Colonial secreteray at the time declaring that St. George’s Caye Day be celebrated on the 10th day of September. Today, over 2 centuries later this day is celebrated yearly as a national holiday in Belize to commemorate this historic battle.

        <p>The attached picture to the left is a secondary source of a quoted report explaining the efforts the Spanish Crown made to keep away from the British works of logwood cutting. Moreover, it also states that with the peace of Versailles 1783 led to the demarcation of territory for the exclusive purpose of logwood cutting. </p>
