         <p align="left">Above is a Primary source image of a map of Map of British Honduras Compiled from Surveys by J. H. Faber, 1867 it is part of a book entitled; “British Honduras: The invention of a colonial territory. Mapping and spatial knowledge in the 19th century” With the purpose of retracing the genesis of a nation, and to recount the invention of a colonial territory.
            The map of 186725 (Figure 14a) is, to our knowledge, the first made by local authorities (Crown Surveyor) showing the new Colony in its entirety. Antochiw and Breton (1992, p. 64) qualify it as “the definitive map of the English colony of British Honduras.” This official map was made in 1860, though not published until 1867, and in its title refers to the demarcation line of the border with Guatemala and Mexico traced by Lieutenant Abbs in 1867 at the north-west confines of British Honduras. The map is sober, and the lines of the rivers and lagoons are drawn with precision. For the first time, it lists in detail the string of inhabited sites along the rivers, some accompanied by information on the number of inhabitants
