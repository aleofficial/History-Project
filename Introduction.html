    <p align="left">The commencement of what would be more than a century  old dispute began, in the year 1839; where there was a miscommunication whereby Guatemala claimed sovereignty over Belize as an “inheritance” from Spain however it was rejected by the British because neither Spain nor any Central American entity had ever occupied Belizean territory. Fast forward to the 1859 convention (Anglo Guatemalan treaty), Guatemala felt it was a treaty of cession to give up the land which in fact was not the case. It merely established the boundary between Guatemala and the existing territory of British Honduras, which was clearly already under British sovereignty. It was not until 1862 where Britain officially declared that the “law of England shall be the law of the Colony of British Honduras.” In contrast, this did not sit well with the Guatemalans. The Anglo-Guatemalan Treaty (1859) was ratified by both sides, but it was unilaterally abrogated by Guatemala in 1939. Guatemala now claimed the whole territory and refused to recognize Belize when it became independent. A Special agreement signed in 2008 and a referendum held in 2019 in both countries commits both sides to take the dispute to the International Court of Justice to finally resolve this dilemma.</p>
