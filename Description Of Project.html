    <p align="left">In our modern age of information we have accessibility to almost all knowledge and data that we could ever imagine. The fact that we can now have all this information at the easiest convenience is a sign that we have progressed far more than we could have imagined. We quite literally have an insurmountable amount of knowledge at palm of our hands, due to the fact that through simply owning a smartphone we gain access to the largest platform or storage of information that could be possibly achieved.
        The particular reason for choosing to create a website is that information published on the internet will far outlast any book or physical copy of information and is a more conscious form of processing it.
        This is known because once published on the internet any form of documentation or data becomes a part of the vast collection of all intelligence uploaded to the World Wide Web. This data is exempted from all physical damage that a book or printed documents may face, it can also be created, altered and edited without having to utilize and waste finite materials such as paper made from trees and ink, and creating less waste therefore promoting a more sustainable way of sharing knowledge. 
        For these reasons through using technology as a medium to convey information we are creating easily accessible information that will last forever even outliving its author and be available to almost everyone on our planet without having to worry about it decaying or being physically damaged while at the same time helping to conserve our natural resources.
