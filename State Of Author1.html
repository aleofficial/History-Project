         <p align="left">The source was taken from a cover book entitled “Notes: Boundary between British Honduras, and Guatemala No. 13, 1931” that consisted of many backs and forth letters between parties that was directed to his excellency, King George V. The book/ folder does not have a specific author, or reference to whom it was organized by; it is mainly a folder containing compiled copies of reports of conversations between British Honduras, and Guatemala in 1931. Even though, there isn’t any information regarding the author, Aside from the fact that we know Fred W Brunton was the appointed Commissioner of British Honduras at the time. Through the validity of the reports (letters) containing official stamps, signatures, and dates along with details from surrounding events, it can be confirmed that these files were legitimate and indeed these were the signatory commissioners that were appointed at the time.
